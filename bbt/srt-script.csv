00:03:14:269,00:03:18:654,for your information i also gave leonard one hell of a high five,Howard
00:03:18:656,00:03:22:742,im kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people,Bernadette
00:03:22:744,00:03:26:696,theyre doing space day and nasa asked me i felt like i couldnt say no,Howard

00:03:33:671,00:03:37:790,great and while were at it maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound,Bernadette
00:03:39:177,00:03:41:093,whats wrong with the way i run ,Howard
00:03:41:095,00:03:43:379,oh just kidding nothing,Bernadette
00:03:51:556,00:03:54:941,sheldon im surprised youd choose to go to a pub ,Penny
00:03:54:943,00:04:03:866,at our committee meeting amy made a motion for a picnic in a park but i tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon,Sheldon
00:04:03:868,00:04:05:952,i then suggested a pub ,Amy
00:04:05:954,00:04:11:290,yeah which i was initially of until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding,Sheldon
00:04:11:292,00:04:13:409,you dont even like yorkshire pudding ,Leonard
00:04:13:411,00:04:19:215,no its yucky but informing people about the history of yorkshire is yummy yumyum,Sheldon
00:04:19:217,00:04:25:004,after a lively debate that proposal passed by a twozero margin,Amy
00:04:25:006,00:04:28:424,nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive,Leonard
00:04:31:179,00:04:36:766,ignore them amy theyre just jealous because theyll never have a relationship as good as ours,Sheldon
00:04:38:186,00:04:41:821,isnt this when he says bazooka or something ,Penny
00:04:41:823,00:04:49:362,i wasnt making a joke i was merely stating fact amy and i have a superior relationship to yours,Sheldon
00:04:49:364,00:04:51:697,you dont honestly think that do you ,Leonard
00:04:51:699,00:05:06:512,leonard i assumed you knew the ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and amy howard and bernadette raj and his girlfriend penny and chardonnay penny and you,Sheldon
00:05:09:133,00:05:14:103,there isnt any ranking and if there were we wouldnt be at the bottom of it,Leonard
00:05:14:105,00:05:16:939,yeah and actually i drink sauvignon blanc ,Penny
00:05:18:810,00:05:20:810,thats the part you have a problem with ,Leonard
00:05:20:812,00:05:22:728,relax ,Penny
00:05:22:730,00:05:28:484,there they go fighting again youd never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc,Amy
00:05:31:789,00:05:35:908,so you never played baseball as a kid not even little league,Raj
00:05:35:910,00:05:44:583,well i was going to but the day of tryouts i found my dads playboy collection threw my arm out,Howard
00:05:46:671,00:05:50:923,all right the pitchers mound in major league baseball is feet six inches away from home plate,Bernadette
00:05:50:925,00:06:02:401,great you take this and say when to stop how much further,Howard
00:06:02:403,00:06:04:403,keep going ,Bernadette

00:06:31:215,00:06:35:968,you realize this isnt one of those times i want you to exaggerate how long something is,Howard
00:06:41:359,00:06:49:899,okay i got to i i i i got to ask what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isnt,Leonard
00:06:49:901,00:06:53:652,for starters we enjoy spending time together,Sheldon
00:06:57:625,00:07:03:129,so do we and ive seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things,Leonard
00:07:03:131,00:07:06:632,its called parallel play ,Sheldon
00:07:06:634,00:07:08:334,yeah toddlers do that ,Leonard
00:07:08:336,00:07:11:253,not as well as we do ,Sheldon
00:07:12:507,00:07:15:257,you believe this guy he has to be the best at everything ,Leonard
00:07:15:259,00:07:17:476,so what why do you even care ,Penny
00:07:17:478,00:07:22:181,oh listen to them not even married and the honeymoons over,Sheldon
00:07:22:183,00:07:26:902,whatever you cant even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement,Leonard
00:07:26:904,00:07:43:786,if youve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract id like to tell you about  plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the us constitution and it may not be cool to say so but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today,Sheldon
00:07:46:090,00:07:51:460,its a good thing im not wearing flag underwear right now cause theres about to be a fire,Amy
00:07:57:101,00:08:03:639,okay its not that hard you just look to where you want to throw it step towards where you want to throw and throw it,Bernadette
00:08:06:561,00:08:16:152,thats your help thats like saying heres how you fly a plane get in the airplane know where you want to go and fly it,Howard
00:08:17:488,00:08:19:989,just throw the ball lets see what were working with ,Bernadette

00:09:17:344,00:09:19:093,may i have one of your fries ,Sheldon
00:09:19:095,00:09:22:630,of course can i have a bite of your burger,Amy

00:09:24:634,00:09:28:636,some perfect couple he wont even share his food with her,Leonard
00:09:28:638,00:09:37:729,it has avocado on it shes allergic to avocado are you so jealous of our relationship you want amy to die,Sheldon
00:09:37:731,00:09:44:869,im not jealous i just think its silly for you to compare relationships like theyre something that can be quantified,Leonard
00:09:44:871,00:09:55:046,everything is quantifiable that french fry a seven spiderman a nine the number nine oddly only a four,Sheldon
00:09:55:048,00:09:56:998,how ridiculous is he ,Leonard
00:09:57:000,00:09:59:334,a hundred ,Penny
00:10:01:388,00:10:05:423,sheldon youre just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion,Leonard
00:10:05:425,00:10:16:851,no im not french fries have three variables crispiness saltiness and shape which is why a curly fry only gets a two if i wanted curls for dinner id order a clown wig,Sheldon
00:10:18:021,00:10:21:739,well a relationship is more complicated than a french fry ,Penny
00:10:21:741,00:10:25:109,not according to the work of berscheid snyder and omoto ,Sheldon
00:10:25:111,00:10:29:197,oh what did those rascals do now ,Penny
00:10:29:199,00:10:34:585,they developed the relationship closeness inventory which predicts the stability of a couple based on,Amy
00:10:31:701,00:10:40:458,yeah not to be confused with the french fry goodness inventory thats pure cooper,Sheldon
00:10:40:460,00:10:42:260,so this is accurate ,Leonard
00:10:42:262,00:10:47:015,its been around for  years and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers,Sheldon
00:10:47:017,00:10:49:534,well kind of takes the romance out of relationships ,Penny
00:10:49:536,00:10:52:553,kind of it does it perfectly ,Sheldon
00:10:53:273,00:10:56:057,sheldon and i got an eightpointtwo out of ten,Amy
